THINGS TO DO
office hours tomorrow. see notes bellow

- write more of program. probably do this seperate so that
we can test with what we have now and then add
^^ write unparse methods separate
^^ write input file. maybe have it so that we pull some off this as we test them
^^ write .cup changes seperately

For all 4 of below, write associated .cup and ast.java rules
- struct declarations
- functions
- simple expressions
- statements

Base plan
tonight/tomorrow morning before OH
write input file to test the rules that we have written
do above work for 4 things ^^ in separate text documents
read over program and files again to understand it
OH -
ask the questions below. Pretty much we need to learn how to do this, we need to
learn how to start adding rules and stuff. Have him help us to run the parser on the
simple stuff that we have written so far**

** so far we have written code to check for bool and void and struct definitions

other things
set up telemetry (plug in so that we can write together)

questions for office hours
How exactly do we run parser ? Are we doing it right ? What should
print based on our current input and code

Why is our makefile failing ??
