THINGS TO DO
office hours tomorrow. see notes bellow

- write more of program. probably do this seperate so that
we can test with what we have now and then add
^^ write unparse methods separate
^^ write input file. maybe have it so that we pull some off this as we test them
^^ write .cup changes seperately

For all 4 of below, write associated .cup and ast.java rules
- struct declarations
- functions
- simple expressions
- statements

Base plan


questions for office hours
How exactly do we run parser ? Are we doing it right ? What should
print based on our current input and code

Why is our makefile failing ??
